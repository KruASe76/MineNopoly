## Usage

### How to play?

You just build a playing field, place a chest (can also be a barrel or a shulker box) somewhere and call `/mn start <chest coordinates>`!  
To get and remove game items use [chat entries](#valid-in-game-chat-entries) and the book you can get via `/mn book <localization>`.  
_Houses_ and _Hotels_ are meant to be placed on street cells; all other items are meant not to be used in any way except keeping in the inventory and transferring between the players.  
To finish the game return all the game items to the bank (and type `--` to remove them) and call `/mn finish`; if you can't return them one of the server operators (by default) should call `/mn finish forced`.

### Commands

`/minenopoly` is the main plugin command, which has the alias `/mn`.
